This is a little exercise designed to explore some of the practical differences between RMarkdown and Quatro. Enjoy!!! 


## From R to Quarto!

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>. In this little exercise we are going to explore some of the differences between R and Quarto.

## Meet the Penguins

```{r}
#| label: load-packages
#| message: false

library(tidyverse)
library(palmerpenguins)

```

The penguins data from the [`palmerpenguins`](https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/) package contains size measurements for 344 penguins, collected and made available by Dr. Kristen Gorman and the Palmer Station, Antarctica LTER, a member of the Long Term Ecological Research Network.

The plot below shows the relationship between flipper and bill length of three types of penguins:

```{r}
#| label: visualize

penguins %>% drop_na() %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = bill_length_mm)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = species, shape = species)) +
  labs(
    title = "flipper and bill length", 
    x = "flipper length (mm)", 
    y = "bill length (mm)", 
    shape = "Penguin species"
  ) + 
  theme_minimal()
  

```

## Exercises:

1.  Knit your document in RMarkdown and check the result.

2.  Change the file format from RMarkdown to Quarto by renaming it, changing the extension from `rmd` to `qmd`. Remember to change the output option in the YAML to `format: html`. Then simply render the result. (tick render on save)

3.  Change the format to a pdf.

4.  Hide the code in two stages. First, by adding the option on `echo` on one of the chunks. Second, by adding a global option via the `execute:` option in the yaml.

5.  Change the output to presentation slides by changing the format to `revealjs`.

6.  Place the plot on a separate slide by adding a header. Use the `/` character and explore the different types of objects you can insert in your document.

7.  Add another document and call it `index.qml`, then add a `quarto.yml` file, restart your session and create a web-site!
